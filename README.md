# FRIDGE

_FRIDGE_ is a simple macOS menubar application that maintains the functionality of storing files on the desktop, but without the visual clutter.
The idea is that _FRIDGE_ holds the files that you would like quick access to jump back into without needing to navigate the file explorer or without it taking up space on the desktop.

Files or file groups can be stored for quick access from the menubar, with a maximum of 4 slots available. 
A file group takes up a single slot and stores up to 4 files. Nested file groups are not supported.

A limit of 4 files (or 16, if four file groups are used) is enforced to keep the workflow focused.
