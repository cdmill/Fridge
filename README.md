# FRIDGE

**Fridge** brings a _quick access, read later_ (QARL) implementation to the macOS menu bar.
It maintains the functionality of storing files on the desktop, but without the visual clutter.

Files or file groups can be stored for quick access from the menubar, with a maximum of 4 slots available. 
A file group takes up a single slot and stores up to 4 files. Nested file groups are not supported.

A limit of 4 files (or 16, if four file groups are used) is enforced to keep the workflow focused.

Fridge automatically updates file references if they are renamed or moved.
