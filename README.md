# FRIDGE

_Fridge_ is a simple macOS menubar application that maintains the functionality of storing files on the desktop, but without the visual clutter.

Files or file groups can be stored for quick access from the menubar, with a maximum of 4 slots available. 
A file group takes up a single slot and stores up to 4 files. Nested file groups are not supported.

A limit of 4 files (or 16, if four file groups are used) is enforced to keep the workflow focused.

Files can be moved or renamed after adding them to _Fridge_, they will be automatically updated so that they don't need to be readded.
