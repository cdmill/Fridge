Simple, lightweight, quick-access file launcher for the macOS menubar.

As of version `1.1` a maximum of 4 file slots are available to keep the workflow focused.

This project is currently fairly barebones, working on it whenever I have time.
I would like to be able to have folders and maybe a few other features added sometime in the future.

Feel free to share, open issues, and/or contribute to this project ðŸ’•
