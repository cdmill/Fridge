Simple, lightweight, quick-access file launcher for the macOS menubar.

Store file URLs that you'll need later so that you can quickly open them from the menu bar.
I started this project because I found myself reading or needing to frequently reference files and I was tired of navigating Finder or storing the files on the desktop.

As of version `1.1` a maximum of 4 file slots are available.
This is enforced to keep the workflow focused, 
but a possible future feature could be _file groups_ which would provide more file slots while providing some form of organization.
