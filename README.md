Simple, lightweight, quick-access file storage for the macOS menubar.

---

Fridge brings a _quick access, read later_ (QARL) implementation to the macOS menu bar.
It maintains the functionality of storing files on the desktop, but without the visual clutter.

As of version `1.1`, a maximum of 4 file slots are available.
This is enforced to keep the workflow focused, but a possible future feature could be _file groups_ which would provide more file slots while providing some form of organization.
